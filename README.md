# MemoPath

# Terminal python game where two players need to go from one side of a square grid-based field to the opposite one (player 1: west to east; player 2: east to west), avoiding traps.
# Players follow the same path but in opposite directions. The grid based-field and the path are randomly created every time. Four difficulty level are available: easy (5x5), medium (7x7), hard (9x9) and insane (12x12).
# A random player start. Every turn each player can move by one cell. If the cell belong to the right path, the player can move by another cell in the same turn. This goes on until the player makes a mistake and falls in a trap. Then the turn ends. The trap bring back the player to the beginning of the path and the turn of the other player starts.
# To win the players need to memorize the path, mistake by mistake, turn by turn. Both players are aware of their counterpart, meaning that they can take advantage from the opponent's mistake for the part of the path that the opponent have already crossed.
